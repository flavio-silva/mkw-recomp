# Initial research (30/10/2026)

Game copy: `exefs/` 40 MB + `romfs/` 23 GB, 205 781 files. Program id `0400C3F00006E000`.

## The executable

Measured with the `recomp/nso.py` loader (from totk-pc-recomp) on the decompressed NSOs.

| Module | Text | Image | Dynamic symbols | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` | 42 MB | 54 MB | 1 289 imported, 151 exported | the game |
| `sdk` | 7.8 MB | 14 MB | 27 427 exported | SDK 19.3.3, `spec: Ounce` (Switch 2), NVN2 driver inside |
| `subsdk0` | 2.6 MB | 3.6 MB | 216 imported | Mono (.NET) runtime; `main` imports nothing from it except `nn::ecli::Allocate/Deallocate` |
| `rtld` | 8 KB | 64 KB | — | dynamic linker; not needed in a recomp |

- The same NSO0 (LZ4) and MOD0 format as Switch 1. `main.npdm`: Switch 2 ACID (signature area 0x300, not 0x200),
  cores 0-5 (mask 0x3f), new services `banana`, `audsmx:u`, `ngc:u`, `notif:a`, `ectx:aw`.
- `main`'s imports by namespace: `nn::audio` 234, `nn::os` 127, `nn::codec` 77, `nn::hid` 57, `nn::movie` 52,
  `nn::util` 48, `nn::async` 44, `nn::socket` 32, `nn::fs` 27… NVN2 comes in through `nvnBootstrapLoader` +
  `nv::InitializeGraphics` (as NVN1).
- NVN2: ~701 function names in `sdk` (`CommandBuffer*` 202, `Texture*` 97, `Device*` 61, `Dlss*` 54, ray tracing
  acceleration `CommandBufferBindAccelerationStructure*`). Approximate regex.
- Engine: Nintendo EPD's. In `romfs/`: `RSDB`, `Phive`, `Banc`, `AI` (`.ainb`), `GymlArchive`, `Lib/{agl,gsys,sead}`,
  shaders `*.Nin_Ounce_NVN2.bfsha.zs`, 68 % of the files as `.zs` (zstd). In `main`: `sead::` 16 strings, `agl::` 40,
  `gsys::` 23, `phive` 311, Havok `hknp` 1 100, `ainb` 85, `gyml` 119. No RTTI.

## Switch 2 hardware (T239)

- CPU: 8 × Cortex-A78C (6 for the game), ARMv8.2 + PAC (v8.3/v8.6). ~1 GHz.
- GPU: Ampere, 1 536 CUDA cores (12 SMs, own count), RT and tensor (DLSS). Shaders in SM86 SASS.
- 12 GB LPDDR5X, 102 GB/s.
- Sources: [Switchbrew T239](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Switch_2:_Tegra_T239),
  [TechSpot](https://www.techspot.com/news/107922-nintendo-finally-clarifies-switch-2-custom-nvidia-processor.html).

Instructions in `main` that a Switch 1 lifter lacks (count from eden-nx2, `NX2_NOTES.md` row "Titles"): RETAA/B
114 767, LDAPR 37 560, LSE atomics 24 718, CAS 6 640, SWP 2 470, CASP 6, XPAC 7, PAC 2, STG 1. PAC is treated as
identity and MTE tags as 0 (eden-nx2, row 3).

Its spin loop search is taken (through totk-pc-recomp: `tools/cpu/spin_waits.py`).

Ported to Vulkan in `runtime/gfx/vk/device/vk_framegen.c` and `runtime/shaders/fg_*.comp`, cited; the three-level search and the per-pixel choice of vector are ours.

The base of the SM86 decoder (`sm86/decode`); `intercept.c`, `funnel.py`, `parse_sidl.py` and `sidl_*.py` copied unchanged into `sm86/spec`, which builds the spec on the player's machine.

## NVN2 against NVN1 (measured)

- NVN2's name table in `sdk` (0xb74c26-0xb79b76): 699 functions. Against the NVN1 one of the Switch 1 game
  (`totk-pc-recomp/runtime/nvn_procs.inc`, 537): **529 with the same name**, 170 new, 8 of NVN1 gone (debug markers
  and `*NvRm*NVX`). That the signature did not change in those 529 was a hypothesis, checked as the calls were
  translated.
- New ones by group: DLSS 54, `ProgramBuilder` 20 (programs are created with a builder), mesh/task
  (`DrawMeshTasks*`), ray tracing (`*AccelerationStructure*`, `DispatchRays*`), push constants, device messages, HDR
  in `Window*`, variable rate shading, exclusive scissor.
- `main` holds all 700 names (the loader's whole table); which ones it really calls is measured from the references
  of the translated code.
- DLSS: `main` creates its network with `nvnDlssNetwork*` and evaluates it with `nvnCommandBufferEvaluateDlss`. It
  sits behind an option, off by default; an AMD GPU has no host DLSS.

## Shaders

`romfs/Shader/`: 9.3 MB compressed, 55 MB uncompressed. Six `DriveRefreshUber.*.bfsha` (FSHA with a BNSH inside, four
in `Procedural`) and `Drive.Nin_Ounce_NVN2.release.sarc` (another bfsha and agl's `sharcb`, `BAHS`): the same
containers as the Switch 1 game. It is a closed set: all of them can be translated ahead of time. eden-nx2 dumped
1 712 distinct MKW programs at run time (row 88).

Game version: `romfs/System/Resource/ResourceSizeTable.Product.100…` points to 1.0.0 (no `control.nacp`). The latest
is 1.8.0 (09/09/2026).
